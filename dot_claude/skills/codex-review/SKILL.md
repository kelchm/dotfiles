# Codex Review

Codex (gpt-5.5) is an independent reviewer. Reach for it when the user wants a second-pass review, or when a change is broad enough that a separate model's perspective helps.

## Workflow

1. Identify the review target: uncommitted changes, base branch, commit SHA, PR checkout, or specific files.
2. Create a temporary artifact directory for the Codex report.
3. Run `codex review` with a focused review prompt.
4. Read Codex's report and verify important claims against the code before presenting them.

Use one of these command shapes:

```bash
ARTIFACT_DIR="$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/codex-review.XXXXXX")"
REPORT="$ARTIFACT_DIR/report.md"
PROMPT="$ARTIFACT_DIR/prompt.md"

# Review staged, unstaged, and untracked changes.
codex -C "$PWD" review --uncommitted - < "$PROMPT" > "$REPORT"

# Review current branch against a base branch.
codex -C "$PWD" review --base main - < "$PROMPT" > "$REPORT"

# Review a single commit.
codex -C "$PWD" review --commit <sha> - < "$PROMPT" > "$REPORT"
```

## Review Prompt

Ask Codex to use a code-review stance:

```text
Review these changes for bugs, regressions, missing tests, security issues, and requirement mismatches.

Prioritize findings over summary. For each finding include:
- severity
- file and line reference
- concrete failure mode
- suggested fix direction

Do not edit files. If there are no substantive findings, say so and name any residual test gaps.
```

Add task-specific context when useful: requirements, risky areas, expected behavior, relevant tests, or files Claude is unsure about.

## Reporting Back

Before relaying a Codex finding, inspect the cited code or diff enough to decide whether the finding is real. In the user-facing response, separate confirmed issues from Codex suggestions you did not verify.

If Codex finds nothing, say that clearly and mention what review target it inspected.

If `codex` is not installed or the command fails, report the error and offer to review the changes directly instead.

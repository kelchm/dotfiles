## Install

### macOS

```bash
brew install chezmoi
chezmoi init --apply --ssh kelchm
```

Or as a one-liner on a fresh machine:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply --ssh kelchm
```

### Windows

```powershell
winget install twpayne.chezmoi
chezmoi init --apply --ssh kelchm
```

Or as a one-liner:

```powershell
irm get.chezmoi.io/ps1 | powershell -c - -- init --apply --ssh kelchm
```

## Usage

```bash
chezmoi edit ~/.config/starship.toml   # edit a managed file
chezmoi diff                            # preview pending changes
chezmoi apply                           # apply changes to home directory
chezmoi cd                              # cd into source directory
chezmoi add ~/.some/new/file            # start managing a new file
```

### Harness CLIs and RTK

These ship too often to pin or to upgrade on every `chezmoi apply`. Chezmoi bootstraps them (`latest` in `mise.toml`); mise upgrades them.

- Harness CLIs: Claude Code, Codex, Grok Build, OpenCode
- Filter (not an agent): RTK
- Vendor self-updaters are off so mise stays the owner

```bash
chezmoi apply              # install if missing
mise run harness:outdated  # what would bump
mise run harness:update    # actually bump
```

On a machine that already had Homebrew, npm, or WinGet copies: apply, then uninstall those so the mise shims are what `which` finds.

## How it works

- Files are stored in chezmoi's source format (`dot_` prefix replaces leading `.`)
- Files ending in `.tmpl` are [Go templates](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/templating/) with OS-conditional logic
- `modify_` templates merge a small invariant into a tool-owned config file without replacing the rest of the file
- `.chezmoiignore` controls which files deploy on which OS
- `fish_variables` is intentionally not managed — Fish manages it automatically; important variables are set in `config.fish`
